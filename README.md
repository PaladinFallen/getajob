# Get A Job!
A Minecraft: Java Edition Datapack

Author: Bazoqa

## Intro 
Ever wonder why only the farmer villager actually *works* during the day planting crops, while every other villager profession sort of just stands around? Well not anymore! This datapack adds cool new daily work tasks to the other villager professions.

Villagers must have an assigned job site block for them to work, and most will only work during the normal villager work day schedule (ticks 2000 to 12000).

## Professions

### *- Butcher*
Butchers will periodically kill nearby farm animals. They will only kill an animal if they see 2 other animals of the same type nearby.

Applicable Animals:
- Cow
- Mooshroom
- Sheep
- Pig
- Chicken
- Rabbit

### *- Cartographer*
Every few days, cartographers will give hints to nearby players about the location of nearby structures.

### *- Cleric*
The cleric plays an important role in any community! They have 2 tasks they will perform regardless of the time of day.

The first is **blessing**. Whenever a player prays (sneaks) near a cleric, the cleric will remove msot negative effects, and will bestow conditional positive effects. For example, fire resistance if the player is on fire, slow falling if the player is falling, regeneration if the player is low, etc.

Secondly, clerics will also attempt to cure nearby zombie villagers. Note that the process still takes time like normal, so be sure to keep your clerics safe!

### *- Fisherman*
Fishermen villagers will, well, fish! They will periodically kill nearby aquatic mobs and bring the items they drop at their feet.

### *- Leatherworker*
Leatherworkers will regularly craft and place saddles on nearby saddle-able mobs. This includes all types of horse variants, pigs, and striders.

### *- Librarian*
Librarians are bookworms at heart. Once a week, they will fill an empty lectern with an enchanted book with random enchantments (Enchantment level is selected randomly from 5-25).

### *- Mason*
The mason is used to cutting up blocks all day! They will regularly break blocks above nearby stonecutters. Cannot break unbreakable blocks, chests, barrels, or obsidian.

### *- Shepherd*
The shepherd takes care of his flock! Shepherds will use wheat, carrots, and seeds to breed nearby animals:

- Cow
- Mooshroom
- Sheep
- Pig
- Rabbit
- Chicken

Note that the shepherd needs the correct type of food to breed the corresponding mob. Wheat for cows, carrots for pigs, seeds for chickens, etc.

They will also shear nearby sheep.

### *- Armorer, Weaponsmith, Toolsmith, Fletcher*
These "smithing" professions will, once a day, repair some of the durability of any corresponding item placed above their work block. 

For example, placing an pickaxe above a toolsmith's smithing table will cause him to repair it once a day.

Fully repairing an item may take several days for high-durability items made out of netherite and diamond, but after an item has been repaired once, it will glow and not despawn until a player picks it up. You can check back after several days to retrieve your repaired gear!

Each profession will only repair items related to their profession.

### *- Nitwit*
Even when getting everyone in the village to pull their weight, there's always some stragglers! Nitwits are now mischievous pranksters. They'll run around the village launching fireworks, imitating players and mobs, and play all sorts of pranks during the work day.
